# -computersProject_Yam-Mandelblit-Zachar
this is my project for the computers course in TAU

A project by Yam Mandelblit Zachar

This project contains one python module - main.py.

It reads data from an input file and checks for problems in the data. If no problem was found,
the program plots the data and returns a graph with a linear fit and the parameters of that fit, as well
as the values of chi2 and chi2_reduced.
